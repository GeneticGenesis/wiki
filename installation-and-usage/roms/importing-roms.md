  * Mobile Apps
  * AirDrop ¬∑ macOS ‚Üí iOS¬π _or_  iOS ‚Üí iOS

**Requirements**

* üõë _All_ ROMs _**must**_ be [formatted correctly](formatting-roms.md) before importing. \([Formatting ROMs](formatting-roms.md)\)
* ‚òëÔ∏è Certain systems _**require**_ [BIOS](../bios-requirements.md) files in order to play ROMs. \([BIOS Requirements](../bios-requirements.md)\)
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please refer to the [Known Issues](importing-roms.md#known-issues) regarding Importing ROMs, and read [Issues Usage](https://github.com/Provenance-Emu/Provenance/wiki/Issues-Usage) _before_ posting a new one.

3. Web Server Active. Make note of the `[device-ip]` 
   * Web UI: `http://[device-ip]`
   * WebDAV: `http://[device-ip]:81`

‚è¨ Mass-uploading ROM libraries or uploading multiple ROMs simultaneously is supported.  
‚Ü©Ô∏è [Restoring](../../info/miscellaneous/restoring-files.md) files \(ROMs, BIOS, Saves, Cover Art\) is also supported in both methods.

### Web Server UI

1. On computer, go to the URL `http://[device-ip]` in the pop-up dialog.

3. Upload your ROMs‚Ä¶
   * `Upload Files‚Ä¶` _button allows multiple file selections._
   * _Drag & Drop is also supported._

### WebDAV Clients

1. On computer, open a WebDAV Client‚Ä¶
   * macOS Finder: `Menu Bar` ‚Üí `Go` ‚Üí `Connect to Server...`
2. Enter `http://[deviceip]:81` ‚Üí `Connect as Guest` ‚Üí Provenance mounts as a new drive.
3. Drag & Drop or Copy/Paste your ROMs into:
   * `roms` \(v1.4, previous\)
   * `Imports` \(v1.5+\)
4. _\(Optional\)_ tvOS: Enable Background Web Server option in Settings, if preferred.

## Copying

### Mobile Apps

1. Open app where ROMs are stored or accessible‚Ä¶
   * _Apple Files \(_[_iCloud Drive_](https://www.apple.com/icloud/icloud-drive)_,_ [_Dropbox_](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dropbox/id327630330)_,_ [_Google Drive_](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-drive/id507874739)_,_ [_Nextcloud_](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/nextcloud/id1125420102)_,_ [_FileBrowser_](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/filebrowser-computers-cloud/id364738545)_, etc‚Ä¶\)_
2. Navigate to your ROMs directory and tap the ROM you wish to copy to Provenance _or_ its button that gets you to a `Share` or `Export` option, depending on the app.
3. Locate and tap `Copy to Provenance` option. Done.

### AirDrop

1. Open AirDrop window via macOS Finder.
2. Drag & Drop file\(s\) onto yourself/your device.

‚è¨ Mass-copying is supported, just drag & drop multiple files.

## Injecting

### ~~iTunes~~

‚ö†Ô∏è iTunes File Sharing support is currently unsupported‚Ä¶

### Other Tools

1. Connect device to computer and open [DiskAid](https://imazing.com/diskaid), [iExplorer](https://macroplant.com/iexplorer), [iPhone Explorer](https://www.macblurayplayer.com/iphone-explorer-mac.htm), or similar app‚Ä¶ ‚Ü©Ô∏è
2. Locate Provenance App.
3. Navigate to‚Ä¶ 
   * `Documents/roms`  \(v1.4, previous‚Ä¶\)
   * `Documents/Imports`  \(v1.5+\)  

```text
 \(if the folder doesn't exist inside `Documents`, create it\)  
```

1. Drag your ROMs into the `roms` \(v1.4\) or `Imports` \(v1.5\) folder. Done.

‚Ü©Ô∏è [Restoring](../../info/miscellaneous/restoring-files.md) files \(ROMs, saves, cover art\) is usually supported in these apps‚Ä¶

## **üí¢ Troubleshooting**

* Multiple ROMs from one archive? You may be using a Region Pack ROM, meaning more than one version of the same ROM is in your archive. Unarchive the set, isolate single region ROM file\(s\), \[[re-archive](formatting-roms.md#archiving), and‚Ä¶\] re-import the single region ROM, individually.

## **‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues**

* Sometimes _loose_ `.bin` for CD-based game files are picked up as Sega Genesis/MegaDrive ROMs. Please refer to [Multi-file ROMs](formatting-roms.md#multi-file-roms) and [Multi-disc Games](formatting-roms.md#multi-disc-games) \(v1.4\).
* CD-based, or multi-file ROMs and especially multi-disc games need to be uploaded and processed _one at a time_, until the Game Importer can be built to handle these in a queue. If yours are broken, it's best to delete the game\(s\) from the app UI, and delete any file remnants in the file system in ROMs \(com.provenance.\[system\]\) and from Imports using the WebUI, WebDav or an iOS file manager, and re-upload.
* Failed checksum ROMs \(translations, hacks, etc‚Ä¶\) will not be matched automatically.
* Exhaustive meta data web-scraping fallbacks to additional sources for meta data are _not_ currently implemented.
* Uploading ROMs + [Custom Cover Art](customizing-roms.md) in _one archive_ may not yield a replacement until the next time Provenance is quit \(with App Switcher\) and relaunched.
